# This is Spoti50

#### A small webapp that uses the Spotify API to find new recommendations based on user inputs

With Spoti50 you can search the Spotify database for albums, tracks and artists with a simple search option.

Or you can use the recommendations page to find recommendations based on your inputs.
The recommendations feature can take up to 5 total inputs and based on that will find up to 100 different songs you may like.

In both features results are listed with song/album name and artists as well as the album cover or the artist image, which is clickable and links to the corresponding spotify webpage.

The net-framework is built with Flask and Jinja using Bootstrap.

Spoti50 works based on the Spotify developer API and the Spotipy Python-module, which allows easy acces to the API over Python
